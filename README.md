# Polymer Webcomponents 
This is a simple customized polymer app hosted live on github pages. The content is pulled from an api json file within the app directory. I customized the content with pictures of my friends and made up text. 

Technology used to make this app:
<ul>
 <li>Polymer.html</li>
 <li>Webcomponents.js</li>
 <li>bower</li>
 <li>json</li>
<ul>

I had a heck of a time getting started and for some reason it was hard for me to find the webcomponents.min.js file. Eventually it was this <a href="https://www.polymer-project.org/0.5/docs/start/tutorial/intro.html">app structure</a> from the <a href="https://www.polymer-project.org/0.5/">polymer website</a> that had everything I needed to get started. From the app structure link I posted above look for the big blue button that says DOWNLOAD STARTER PROJECT. This directory will include a finished app, it's more fun to follow along and work on the directory called starter, which allows you to fill in the blanks. I had to move some files around to get all in the root so it would look good on github pages. Please feel free to ask me any questions about getting started with this project. <a href="mailto:ian@ianposton.com">ian@ianposton.com</a>

I was able to change the navbar color and tabs color on click by changing the css in this hidden files amongst the long list. I changed tab color on click in paper-tab.css id #ink attribute color. I Changed tab underline color on selected in paper-tabs.css id #selectionBar atribute color.

Have Fun with it! It's the future! Send me a case of hot-sauce packets sometime!
